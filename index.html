  <h4 class="w3-center">ABOUT ME</h4>
  <p style="text-align: justify;">Hello and Namaste! I am Aayush Kumar Mishra, currently pursuing a Bachelors of Technology focused in Computer Sciences from The LNM Institute of Information Technology. I am skilled in languages such as C, C++ and Python. I have a good knowledge of MySQL and Android Development as well. I have been a part of several technical projects during my college and some of them are listed down below. Some of my co curricular activities include being a Teaching Assistant for the CSE104 course and being the Team Lead for solving the Audacity's Bug 2125 P3. Some of my extra curricular activities include being a part of the Media Cell LNMIIT and the MUN Society LNMIIT for a while. Apart from this, I am an avid reader and I write as well. I love playing chess, drawing, sketching and cooking. I religiously follow th La Liga (Spanish League Football) and I enjoy playing and watching other sports as well. I am passionate about various social issues such as climate change, violent extremism, education and sustainabilty, therefore I have been a part of forums and conferences regarding this arounf the world.</p>

      <p style="text-align: justify;">International Development Youth Forum was a wonderful and unique experience for me. It gave me an insight on development issues outside of India. I got the opportunity to share my ideas on issues that I am passionate about and work towards implementing those ideas for a stronger global society. It was a week of learning, gaining new insights and making new friends. IDYF's goal is to create a better future based on the diverse values and experiences of youth from around the world. We aim to empower youth, and shape them into leaders of a fairer, more sustainable future, through debates, problem-solving, and networking with peers from a variety of backgrounds. In the forum, we were divided into 6-7 teams and each team will analyze one of the case studies and offer solutions. Case studies were "Bringing education to children in Dharavi, India" and "Developing water infrastructure in Kibera, Kenya". I was a part of the Dharavi Project.</p>

      <p style="text-align: justify;">The Harvard College Project for Asian and International Relations (HPAIR) was founded to create a forum of exchange for students and young professionals to discuss and learn about the most important economic, political, and social issues facing the Asia-Pacific region. Asiaâ€™s astounding growth over the past decade has not been without challenges. Solutions to sustainable development remain elusive; alarming human rights abuses against women, refugees, and the LGBTQ community remain unanswered; rising wealth inequality, catalyzed by globalization, remain unaddressed. The 2019 HPAIR Harvard College Conference gave me a platform to cooperatively confront these emerging challenges in Asia through dialogue and exchange that transcend geographical and cultural borders. Also, for students like me who are unable to totally fund their way into this conference, HPAIR provides scholarships to 20-25 delegates. I am honored to be selected among one of those few delegates. Those few days at Harvard gave my life a new perspective and purpose. I am very thankful to the staff for giving me this opportunity.</p>

      <p style="text-align: justify;">The Emerging Markets & Venture Capital Pitch Impact Challenge was a challenge for us to pursue a rational exploration into different emerging markets across Asia. Teams of delegates were supposed to showcase comprehensive research and collaboration skills, effectively describe innovative ideas, and introduce specific qualities of an emerging market that would make the market attractive to investors. After a day of preparation and opportunities to consult with accomplished mentors, this Impact Challenge culminated in a presentation of an emerging market that is predicted to yield high investment returns to a panel of professional venture capitalists, some of which include Manu Goswami, Richard Robinson and Scott McNally. It was a proud moment for me to have won this challenge.</p>

    <div class="w3-col m6 w3-hide-small w3-padding-large">
      <p style="text-align: justify;">Developing counter-narratives by promoting non-discrimination, tolerance, and respect, including through awareness-raising activities is an essential remedy to hate or extremist speech. ORF along with Facebook India organized and conducted a Voice+ Challenge for higher educational institutions to help students develop and execute campaigns and social media strategies against extremism that are credible, authentic, and believable to their peers and resonate within their communities in India. Here, Students decided which target audience to develop their initiative, product or tool for. Be it the at risk, silent majority (typically people who do not speak out against extremism), is it the uncommitted population which research indicates has a higher probability of radicalising as they explore their searching for identity phase, or is it civic minded students who galvanised around important issues of the day and create movements against extremism. The students of each institution developed a social or digital media initiative, product, or tool to push back on extremism. They got to identify what extremism means to them on their campus, community, country, or globally. Counter-speech is a common, crowd-sourced response to extremism or hateful content. Extreme posts are often met with disagreement, derision, and counter-campaigns. Combating extremism in this way has some advantages: it is faster, more flexible and responsive, capable of dealing with extremism from anywhere and in any language and retains the principle of free and open public spaces for debate. I made it among the top 10 finalists in India and was invited to the "Tackling Insurgent Ideologies" Conference.</p>
